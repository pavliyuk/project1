"Next day before the sunrise every man Was hurrying outside, where in the yard They made big fire and began To boil meat chunks in water and in lard. Five kettles filled with soup were there And four with dumplings good beyond compare, At least six pots of borshch with dill, Besides, huge numbers of cooked rams, And many chickens, geese, and even clams For everyone to eat his fill.
"Large buckets full of whiskey And vats of brandy soon Were ready to be drunk; the horde was frisky When everyone received a spoon. When they were singing ""Rest in peace with saints Aeneas cried without restraints. The binge began full force. They dined Until they could not gulp another bite, And could not stand upright.
The father's soul was not on anybody's mind."
